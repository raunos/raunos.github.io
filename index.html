            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
            It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
            It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.
            It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat,
            which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
            Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's
            home range to establish their own.
        </p>

            The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population
            was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living
            in small isolated pockets. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for
            population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims
            of human–wildlife conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human population density.
